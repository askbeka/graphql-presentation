## a query language for your api

---

## GraphQL:

- is a query language for APIs
- is a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data
- provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API
- gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more
- makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.
