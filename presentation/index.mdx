## a query language for apis

---

**API standart** opensourced by **Facebook** in 2015, that triggerd big shift in industry, enabling beautiful solutions and **amazing OSS** projects, that currently being maintained by huge community of individuals and companies

(**Github, Twitter, IBM, Courseera, Twitch, Pinterest, AirBnB, Shopify, The New York Times, Yelp, KLM**, etc.)

## Problem
 ![rest](/Rest.png)

---

**Overfetching** - means the client is retrieving data that is actually not
needed at the moment when it’s being fetched.
It thus drains performance (more data needs longer to be downloaded and parsed) of the app and also exhausts the user’s data plan.

---

**Underfetching** - is the opposite of overfetching and means that not enough data is included in an API response.
This means the client needs to make additional API requests to satisfy its current data requirements.

## GraphQL:

- is a query language for APIs
- is a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data
- provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API
- gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more
- allows better analytics on backend
- makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.
